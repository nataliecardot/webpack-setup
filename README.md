# webpack-setup

This is a Webpack 4 build intended for reuse from project to project. Includes Sass compilation, use of Babel for JavaScript files, proper loading of media files, and minification of HTML. Development files in `src` are generated in a `dist` folder upon running `npm run build`. Running `npm run start:dev` starts a development server with live reloads.
